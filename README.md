# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Diffusion induced oscillatory insulin secretion.**   
Keener JP. _Bull Math Biol._ 2001 Jul;63(4):625-41.
[11497161](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11497161) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Oscillatory secretion of insulin has been observed in many different
experimental preparations. Here we examine a mathematical model for in vitro
insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells in a flow-through reactor. The
analysis shows that oscillations result because of an important interplay
between flow rate of the reactor and insulin diffusion. In particular, if the
ratio of flow rate to volume of the reaction bed is too large, oscillations
are eliminated, in contradiction to the conclusions of Maki and Keizer (L. W.
Maki and Keizer J. Mathematical analysis of a proposed mechanism for
oscillatory insulin secretion in perifused HIT-15 cells. Bull. Math. Biol.,
57(1995), 569-591). Furthermore, with reasonable numbers for the experimental
parameters and the diffusion of insulin, the model equations do not exhibit
oscillations.
